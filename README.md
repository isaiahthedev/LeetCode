# LeetCode
Welcome to my LeetCode repository.

## Current Progress
- Right now I'm mainly doing easy problems to practice and keep my JavaScript skills fresh.
- When I have more time after completing some portfolio projects and some other courses that I'm doing, I'm going to take a proper month to learn datastructures and algorithms, and then start tackling more medium and some hard level problems
